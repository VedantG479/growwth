Our application aims to revolutionize professional development by providing a structured and personalized learning platform for technical skills enhancement. It offers custom learning paths based on individual schedules and deadlines, enabling users to follow personalized roadmaps. Additionally, the app sends daily task reminders with AI-generated descriptions, study resources, and reminders to keep users on track.

Users can submit projects at specific milestones to showcase their progress, which are then reflected in detailed profiles that highlight their roadmap progress and project quality.

Recruiters can gain insights into candidates' skills and growth trajectories, based on their technical skillset profile made on our platform.

We will be including ML-based Models to study the users learning graph and their domain knowledge, which will help us to provide them with better personalized roadmaps and recommendations.
